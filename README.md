# Fitness Tracker

A project which started at the end of 2024 as I wanted to look into making 2025 a year where I would focus on my health a bit more. The idea in mind is to be able to log and keep track of what exercises you do throughout the day, week, month or year and be able to just keep track of your progress. Similar to The Push-Up Challenge's app and the counter within it.
